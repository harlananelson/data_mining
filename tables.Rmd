# Create two way tables of categorical variables.

First, get a list of the fields
```{r}
sapply(d,"class")
```
Create a tabulation
```{r}
tab <- d %$% table(left_f,number_project)
print(t)
```
Calculate a chisquared measure of association.
You can see that of  the people who left, 43.9% has only two projects and most of the people who
stayed had 3 or 4 projects.
```{r}
d %$% CrossTable(left_f,number_project,chisq=TRUE,prop.r=TRUE,prop.c = FALSE,expected=FALSE)
```
Create some plots of the table. 
The bars are above zero if there are more observations than expected and below zero if there or less
```{r}
assoc(t)
```

```{r}
mosaic(t)
```

```{r}
plot(ca(t))
```
